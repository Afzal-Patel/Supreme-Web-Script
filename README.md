# SupremeWebScript

This script is for educational purposes only!

demo: https://youtu.be/MEhCroJafZ0
I have included a short, slowed down (by using a delay) 
clip of the script being run.

This has been successfully used in the past 
(last august), but may need to be updated (as of Oct. 2019).

The script gets the user to the check-out page. 
Then the CVV must be entered manually, and finally the checkout button
must also be clicked manually.

It was used with mozilla firefox and 
geckdriver:
