# SupremeWebScript

This script is for educational purposes only!

I have included (false information on the checkout page)
a short, slowed down (by implementing a delay) 
clip of the code being run for reference.


This has been successfully used in the past 
(worked last august), but
it may need to be updated (as of Jul 2019).

The script gets the user to the check-out page. 
Then the CVV must be entered manually, and finally checkout button
must also be clicked manually.

It was used with mozilla firefox and 
geckdriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 


GL!
