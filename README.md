# SupremeWebScript

I have successfully used this script in the past (worked last august); It may need to be updated (as of Jul 2019).

The script gets the user to the check-out page. 
Then the CVV must be entered manually, and finally checkout must also be clicked manually.

It was used with mozilla firefox and geckdriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 

GL!
